                <p>Sometimes it's hard enough just sharing a restaurant bill. Try sharing that bill week in, week out and you might encounter more than a few snares. But not with Hapu. Simply set your rates and our automated payment system takes care of the rest. You need never talk money or who owes what.</p>
